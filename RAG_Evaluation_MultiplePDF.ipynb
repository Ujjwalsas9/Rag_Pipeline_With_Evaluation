    "### **Problem Statement**\n",
    "\n",
    "In this course, we are going to build and evaluate an **advanced multi-PDF Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system** specifically designed for the **healthcare domain**.\n",
    "\n",
    "We used multiple research papers, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **_“Health Care System in India : An Overview”_**  \n",
    "- **_“Digital Transformation in Healthcare Industry: A Survey”_**\n",
    "\n",
    "We applied key RAG techniques such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Chunking**\n",
    "- **Embedding**\n",
    "- **Multi-document retrieval**\n",
    "- **Context-based response generation**\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we are focusing on evaluating our system’s performance. Using **DeepEval**, we assess:\n",
    "\n",
    "-  **Retrieval relevance and precision**  \n",
    "-  **Answer accuracy and relevancy**  \n",
    "-  **Hallucination detection and faithfulness**\n",
    "\n",
    "This comprehensive process—from multi-PDF ingestion to evaluation—helps us build **reliable and trustworthy AI systems** in healthcare. These systems must support **clinical decision-making** where **safety, accuracy, and contextual grounding** are critical.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our goal is to ensure the RAG system works effectively in real-world scenarios involving **MIoT** and **ICE platforms** by delivering **accurate, safe, and context-aware responses**.\n",

    "### Function: `pdf_chatbot_pipeline`\n",
    "\n",
    "This function defines the complete **multi-PDF RAG pipeline**, integrating all key stages:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Pipeline Overview:\n",
    "1. **PDF Handling**  \n",
    "   - Loads new PDFs only if they haven’t been processed before.\n",
    "   - Avoids redundant embedding by checking existing vector store.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Chunking & Embedding**  \n",
    "   - Chunks the document content.\n",
    "   - Embeds the chunks into a Chroma vector store (either by creating or updating it).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Retrieval**  \n",
    "   - Performs semantic search using the user’s query to fetch top relevant chunks.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Response Generation**  \n",
    "   - Passes the retrieved context to the model to generate a grounded answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Final Output:\n",
    "Returns a dictionary with:\n",
    "- `context`: Retrieved document chunks  \n",
    "- `question`: User's original query  \n",
    "- `AI_generated_response`: Final answer generated from context\n",
    "\n",
    "This pipeline ensures scalable, **efficient** interaction with multiple documents using **retrieval-augmented generation**.\n"

This connectivity allows real-time monitoring of patients through biometric sensors and smart devices, which helps detect critical changes in a patient’s condition more quickly. As a result, healthcare providers can respond faster and more accurately. Additionally, MIoT reduces human errors by automating data collection and ensuring that medical information is accurate and readily available across different care settings—from hospital wards to home care. Overall, this leads to better coordination, quicker interventions, and enhanced patient safety.\n",

    "### Observation:\n",
    "\n",
    "This evaluation demonstrates a strong outcome, though not perfect. When running the **Contextual Precision** metric, the system achieved a **score of 0.87**, indicating that **most retrieved chunks were highly relevant**, but a few less-relevant nodes affected the overall ranking.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why It Worked:\n",
    "- The retriever surfaced multiple **highly relevant, context-aware chunks** that directly aligned with the expected output.\n",
    "- Key content included MIoT’s role in **reducing human error**, **enabling faster responses**, and **improving clinical decision-making**.\n",
    "- These nodes provided a solid foundation for generating a grounded, accurate response.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What Limited the Score:\n",
    "- Two chunks ranked in positions 3 and 4 discussed **encrypted medical records** and **IoT data security**.\n",
    "- While somewhat related to healthcare technology, they were **not directly relevant** to hospital safety, patient monitoring, or the specific improvements outlined in the expected answer.\n",
    "- Their mid-tier ranking slightly reduced the overall contextual precision.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Insight:\n",
    "This evaluation shows that **even strong retrievals can be penalized** when non-essential content is ranked above or alongside key supporting information. **Ranking order matters** as much as content relevance.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Outcome:\n",
    "- **Score:** 0.87 (Above Threshold)\n",
    "- **Verdicts:** 3 relevant chunks, 2 partially/tangentially relevant\n",
    "- **Impact:** Strong performance overall, with minor degradation due to suboptimal chunk ordering\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Takeaway:\n",
    "To further improve contextual precision:\n",
    "- Apply **reranking mechanisms** to ensure that the **most relevant chunks appear first**.\n",
    "- Monitor retrieval output for **topic drift**, especially in middle-ranking positions.\n",

This connectivity allows real-time monitoring of patients through biometric sensors and smart devices, which helps detect critical changes in a patient’s condition more quickly. As a result, healthcare providers can respond faster and more accurately. Additionally, MIoT reduces human errors by automating data collection and ensuring that medical information is accurate and readily available across different care settings—from hospital wards to home care. Overall, this leads to better coordination, quicker interventions, and enhanced patient safety.\n",

    "- Ensure that **the most relevant nodes appear within the first few positions**, as early grounding is key to high contextual precision.\n",

      "\n",
      "1. Increasing inequality in healthcare due to the dominance of private sector five-star hospitals catering to the high-end market, making private healthcare less accessible to weaker sections of society.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. A significant shortage of trained medical personnel, including doctors, nurses, and especially paramedics, with a particular need for personnel willing to serve in rural areas where access to care is limited.\n",

      "3. Systemic constraints despite government focus on health issues, with much still to be done to develop effective and sustainable health systems that can address the dual demands of rising non-communicable diseases and the population’s need for better quality and higher levels of healthcare.\n",

      "4. Affordability and accessibility remain major concerns, with the population facing difficulties in accessing low-cost healthcare alternatives and a low ratio of healthcare providers.\n",

      "5. Additional challenges include a lack of technical infrastructure, absence of standards, privacy concerns, gaps in pharmaceutical, payer, and provider ecosystems, and a lack of comprehensive regulations.\n",

      "6. The need for improved medical education and training, potentially through private sector involvement or public-private partnerships, to address workforce shortages.\n",

      "  - expected output: MIoT (Medical Internet of Things) improves hospital safety by creating a connected environment where medical devices and systems can communicate seamlessly. This connectivity allows real-time monitoring of patients through biometric sensors and smart devices, which helps detect critical changes in a patient’s condition more quickly. As a result, healthcare providers can respond faster and more accurately. Additionally, MIoT reduces human errors by automating data collection and ensuring that medical information is accurate and readily available across different care settings—from hospital wards to home care. Overall, this leads to better coordination, quicker interventions, and enhanced patient safety.\n",

Over time, physicians and hospitals have increasingly adopted marketing and public relations strategies to connect with their communities and raise awareness of the care they offer. These approaches, while often useful for improving visibility and accessibility, have also led to a noticeable shift in how healthcare services are presented.', 'tools of operations management, for example, supply chain management, are useful only to a limited extent... These observations, however, have had little impact on the vast cost of consulting fees... Patients who are sick, or worried that they may be sick, generally, are neither capable of understanding their physiological status nor inclined to shop around for bargains... The value of life often far outweighs the consideration of cost... The root of the disequilibrium in healthcare is the heavy, often total, dependence of the patient on the medical practitioner.', 'Large companies and affluent individuals have started five star hospitals which dominate the \\nspace for high end market.

    "This evaluation demonstrates the ideal outcome for a retrieval-augmented system. When running the **Contextual Recall** metric, the system achieved a **perfect score of 1.0**, confirming that **every sentence in the expected output** was explicitly supported by the retrieved content.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why It Worked:\n",
    "- The retriever surfaced **only highly relevant chunks** that directly aligned with each part of the expected answer.\n",
    "- The retrieved nodes covered the full scope of MIoT’s contributions to hospital safety, including:\n",
    "  - Real-time monitoring\n",
    "  - Faster response times\n",
    "  - Continuous patient tracking via smart sensors\n",
    "  - Reduction of human error\n",
    "  - Asset management and protocol compliance\n",

    "#### Insight:\n",
    "This outcome validates that when the **retrieval context is both complete and topically focused**, it leads to **high-fidelity, grounded answers**. The retrieval strategy successfully captured the full range of concepts required to support the model's generated response.\n",
    "\n",

    "#### Takeaway:\n",
    "To consistently achieve this level of recall:\n",
    "- Maintain **tight topical alignment** in the document set used for retrieval.\n",
    "- Use **fine-grained chunking** to preserve semantic completeness of context nodes.\n",
    "- Ensure **balanced coverage** of all expected answer themes through appropriate indexing and retrieval techniques.\n",

      "\n",
      "1. Increasing inequality in healthcare due to the dominance of private sector five-star hospitals catering to the high-end market, making private healthcare less accessible to weaker sections of society.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. A significant shortage of trained medical personnel, including doctors, nurses, and especially paramedics, with a particular need for personnel willing to serve in rural areas where access to care is limited.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Systemic constraints despite government focus on health issues, with much still to be done to develop effective and sustainable health systems that can address the dual demands of rising non-communicable diseases and the population’s need for better quality and higher levels of healthcare.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Affordability and accessibility remain major concerns, with the population facing difficulties in accessing low-cost healthcare alternatives and a low ratio of healthcare providers.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Additional challenges include a lack of technical infrastructure, absence of standards, privacy concerns, gaps in pharmaceutical, payer, and provider ecosystems, and a lack of comprehensive regulations.\n",

      "6. The need for improved medical education and training, potentially through private sector involvement or public-private partnerships, to address workforce shortages.\n",

      "  - expected output: MIoT (Medical Internet of Things) improves hospital safety by creating a connected environment where medical devices and systems can communicate seamlessly. This connectivity allows real-time monitoring of patients through biometric sensors and smart devices, which helps detect critical changes in a patient’s condition more quickly. As a result, healthcare providers can respond faster and more accurately. Additionally, MIoT reduces human errors by automating data collection and ensuring that medical information is accurate and readily available across different care settings—from hospital wards to home care. Overall, this leads to better coordination, quicker interventions, and enhanced patient safety.\n",

Over time, physicians and hospitals have increasingly adopted marketing and public relations strategies to connect with their communities and raise awareness of the care they offer. These approaches, while often useful for improving visibility and accessibility, have also led to a noticeable shift in how healthcare services are presented.', 'tools of operations management, for example, supply chain management, are useful only to a limited extent... These observations, however, have had little impact on the vast cost of consulting fees... Patients who are sick, or worried that they may be sick, generally, are neither capable of understanding their physiological status nor inclined to shop around for bargains... The value of life often far outweighs the consideration of cost... The root of the disequilibrium in healthcare is the heavy, often total, dependence of the patient on the medical practitioner.', 'Large companies and affluent individuals have started five star hospitals which dominate the \\nspace for high end market.

      "1. Increasing inequality in healthcare due to the dominance of private sector five-star hospitals catering to the high-end market, making private healthcare less accessible to weaker sections of society.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. A significant shortage of trained medical personnel, including doctors, nurses, and especially paramedics, with a particular need for personnel willing to serve in rural areas where access to care is limited.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Systemic constraints despite government focus on health issues, with much still to be done to develop effective and sustainable health systems that can address the dual demands of rising non-communicable diseases and the population’s need for better quality and higher levels of healthcare.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Affordability and accessibility remain major concerns, with the population facing difficulties in accessing low-cost healthcare alternatives and a low ratio of healthcare providers.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Additional challenges include a lack of technical infrastructure, absence of standards, privacy concerns, gaps in pharmaceutical, payer, and provider ecosystems, and a lack of comprehensive regulations.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. The need for improved medical education and training, potentially through private sector involvement or public-private partnerships, to address workforce shortages.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, these challenges highlight the need for more socially relevant private sector efforts, better distribution of healthcare resources, and systemic improvements to meet the healthcare demands of India’s population.\n",
      "  - expected output: MIoT (Medical Internet of Things) improves hospital safety by creating a connected environment where medical devices and systems can communicate seamlessly. This connectivity allows real-time monitoring of patients through biometric sensors and smart devices, which helps detect critical changes in a patient’s condition more quickly. As a result, healthcare providers can respond faster and more accurately. Additionally, MIoT reduces human errors by automating data collection and ensuring that medical information is accurate and readily available across different care settings—from hospital wards to home care. Overall, this leads to better coordination, quicker interventions, and enhanced patient safety.\n",

    "\n",
    "This evaluation resulted in a failed test for contextual relevancy. The system scored **0.56**, falling short of the 0.6 threshold. Although some retrieved statements aligned well with the query, a significant portion of the context included **off-topic or overly broad content**, which diluted the overall relevance.\n",
    "\n",

    "#### Why It Failed:\n",
    "- The retrieval did include **strong statements** about:\n",
    "  - MIoT reducing preventable medical errors\n",
    "  - Deployment of patient-centric networked systems\n",
    "  - Use of biometric devices to enable faster clinical response\n",
    "\n",
    "- However, **several other statements were tangential or unrelated**, including:\n",
    "  - General HIoT-related security concerns\n",
    "  - Statements about **big data analytics**, **corporate success**, and **future planning**\n",
    "  - Placeholder or visual references (e.g., *“Fig. 1”* or *“people with diabetes have ID cards”*)\n",

    "- The presence of **unanchored or off-topic content** weakened the relevance density across the retrieved chunks, ultimately pushing the score below the passing threshold.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Insight:\n",
    "This outcome highlights a common failure mode: **a few irrelevant or generic statements can outweigh otherwise good retrieval**. Contextual relevancy is sensitive to both content quality and topic focus—so every statement needs to be directly aligned with the query’s intent.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Outcome:\n",
    "- **Score:** 0.56 (Fail)\n",
    "- **Relevant statements:** 9\n",
    "- **Off-topic statements:** 7\n",
    "- **Result:** Too much unrelated content diluted the relevancy needed to pass the evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Takeaway:\n",
    "To improve contextual relevancy in RAG systems:\n",
    "- Focus on **retrieving fine-grained, query-specific content**, not general information or forward-looking statements.\n",
    "- Avoid inclusion of **visual labels, metadata, or ungrounded tech claims** (e.g., “Fig. X” or broad HIoT scenarios).\n",
    "- Refine chunking and retrieval logic to increase the **signal-to-noise ratio** across all candidate context elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even a few loosely related or noisy statements can cause the system to fail relevancy metrics—especially in high-stakes, multi-sentence answers.\n"

      "  - expected output: MIoT (Medical Internet of Things) improves hospital safety by creating a connected environment where medical devices and systems can communicate seamlessly. This connectivity allows real-time monitoring of patients through biometric sensors and smart devices, which helps detect critical changes in a patient’s condition more quickly. As a result, healthcare providers can respond faster and more accurately. Additionally, MIoT reduces human errors by automating data collection and ensuring that medical information is accurate and readily available across different care settings—from hospital wards to home care. Overall, this leads to better coordination, quicker interventions, and enhanced patient safety.\n",

When tested with **clean context**, the system performed near the threshold, retrieving mostly relevant statements related to MIoT’s role in hospital safety. However, after **injecting irrelevant content**, the relevancy score **dropped sharply**, confirming how sensitive performance is to the quality of context.\n",

    "#### Clean Context (Before Noise Injection)\n",
    "- **Score:** 0.56  \n",
    "- **Pass Status:**  (Below threshold, but near borderline)  \n",
    "- **Strengths:**  \n",
    "  - Covered clinical aspects like real-time monitoring, error prevention, and patient-centric systems  \n",
    "  - Retrieval was generally focused on hospital safety outcomes  \n",
    "- **Weaknesses:**  \n",

    "- **Weaknesses Introduced:**  \n",
    "  - Included marketing, consulting, and economic perspectives unrelated to MIoT safety benefits  \n",
    "  - Added noise diluted semantic focus and lowered the alignment between context and query  \n",

    "  - Retrieval lost precision due to topic drift and off-topic statements  \n",

Just as relativity tells us that events unfold differently depending on one’s frame of reference, MIoT networks respond dynamically to a patient’s clinical context—location, vitals, and device interactions.\\n\\nSome futurists and AI theorists suggest that, like spacetime in physics, data environments in hospitals may evolve into dynamic, responsive systems that “bend” around the patient’s condition.

This connectivity allows real-time monitoring of patients through biometric sensors and smart devices, which helps detect critical changes in a patient’s condition more quickly. As a result, healthcare providers can respond faster and more accurately. Additionally, MIoT reduces human errors by automating data collection and ensuring that medical information is accurate and readily available across different care settings—from hospital wards to home care. Overall, this leads to better coordination, quicker interventions, and enhanced patient safety.\n",

    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.  Use Only Relevant Chunks for Answer Generation\n",
    "- Ensure that only the **top semantically relevant chunks** are passed to the generation stage.\n",

    "\n",

    "#### 2. Eliminate Noisy Context Before Response Generation\n",
    "- In multi-PDF scenarios, some retrieved chunks (e.g., about healthcare marketing) were **not aligned** with the query.\n",
    "- Before generating an answer, apply a **manual or automated filtering step** to remove irrelevant chunks based on simple keyword or topic matching.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Restrict the Model Using Strict Prompting\n",
    "- Use this instruction before generation:  \n",
    "  _“Generate an answer strictly based on the above context; do not use your own knowledge. If the query is not covered in the context, respond with: 'This query is not as per the PDF.'”_\n",
    "- This prevents **hallucination** and ensures **faithfulness to context**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. Extract & Use Statement-Level Grounded Evidence (for Evaluation)\n",
    "- In metrics like Hallucination, Faithfulness, and G-Eval, we observed better scores when the **response used precise, grounded statements** from context chunks.\n",
    "- Prefer summarizing from **atomic-level claims** rather than full paragraphs.\n",
    "\n",
